Git where all the components from the project "Building a tennis ball launcher from scratch" are shared


Hello,

Here you will be able to find updated information to my ongoing project, where I am building a tennis ball launcher from scratch. 

First, coherent results from simulations can be found and respective files from the simulation will be posted and uptaded. 
The prototype of the model in 3D along with its elements will be shared. The model is first designed for the table tennis and later on redesigned for the tennis ball, after the successfull implementation of the first. 
Real images of the process will support it, as a real evidence of the project. 
The repository also show several annexes with drawings of the dimensions of the model and its components, such as the wheel, etc...
Real elements that make it up will be also shared. Names of the battery, motor, electronics ...
Finnaly, there will be a space where improvements take place.

Thank you.
